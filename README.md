# Bootstrap Test Assignment

[Demo](https://a13ks3y.github.io/bootstrap-test-assignment/)

There is a page layout with a header and a list of picture cards. It should be made according to the layout, using Bootstrap 4 or 5.

## Technical task:
- make according to the layout
- the text in the card should be two lines maximum. If the text has more than two lines, the "show more" button should appear, when you click on it, the entire text will be expanded (make a random text from two to ten lines long)
- there is no design for the mobile version, but you need to adjust at your own discretion in such a way that the layout does not break
## Implementation requirements:
- use Bootstrap (version 4 or 5) as much as possible, and custom styles as a minimum
- JS framework at your discretion (or without a framework at all, and using vanilla JS is even better)
- upload the finished layout to GitHub and host it on GitHub Pages so that you can immediately see the demo and code
## Tasks with an asterisk (optional):
- implement dark theme
- make an infinite scroll for cards that takes data from the address https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=1&limit=9

## What we will pay attention to when checking the task
correspondence of the layout to the layout
HTML semantics
style of JS code

## Road-Map
* Use global prefix to avoid confusing app class names with bootstrap classes
* Use BEM (or similar)
* "Move Up" (scroll to top) feature
* Pixel-perfect
